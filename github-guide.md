Submitting homework with GitHub: a 3-minute guide
-------------------------------------------------

This guide will walk you through creating a GitHub 
account, creating a new repository to contain all 
the homework for one week, and creating new a file for
each assignment in that homework.

### To create a GitHub account ###

1. Head over to [GitHub.com](http://github.com).
2. Enter your choice of username, your CCA email address, and your choice of password.
3. Click the big green "Sign up for GitHub" button.
4. If prompted, choose the "free" plan.

### To create a new repository ###

1.  Click the green "+ New repository" button:
    
    ![New repository](img/new-repository.png?raw=true)

2.  Give your repository a useful name and description,
    make sure the box marked "Initialize this repository with a README" is checked,
    and click the "Create repository" button:
    
    ![New repository options](img/new-repository-name.png?raw=true)

### To create a new file for an assignment ###

1.  Click the "+" link on your repository page:
    
    ![New File](img/new-file.png?raw=true)

2.  Give your new file a sensible name, like "puzzle1.js". The file extension you choose  (".js" here) should match
    the programming language used in the file; for Rudy, that's javascript, so use ".js". 
    For Processing, use ".pde"; for Arduino, use ".ino".
    
    Then, paste your code into the "Edit new file" tab.
    
    Finally, click the "Commit new file" button.
    
    ![New file options](img/new-file-entry.png?raw=true)

3.  If you later wish to make changes to your code, you can do so through github as well. First,
    find the file you'd like to change, and click on the file name:
    
    ![File list](img/file-list.png?raw=true)
    
    Then, click the "Edit this file" icon:
    
    ![Edit file](img/edit-file.png?raw=true)
    
    Make your changes as in step 2 above.
