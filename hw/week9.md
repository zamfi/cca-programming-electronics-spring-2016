### Homework 9

1.  Send me your [practice quiz](img/practice-quiz.pdf) **ASAP** if you haven't yet! This is not optional.

2.  Send me your [final project thoughts](week8.md) **ASAP** if you haven't yet! This is also not optional.

3.  Write a proposal for your final project, and **[send me a link](mailto:jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu) by Sunday at noon**.

    Create a new github repository for your project, and modify the README.md file to include **these four sections**, each of which should have a heading and a description. (To learn about formatting text in .md files, read [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/).)

    - **Summary**: A few paragraphs (half a page?) or so describing the goals of your project. Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use, and how it will be interactive or responsive to the environment.

    - **Component Parts**: From what pieces will you build your project? Will you build or buy those pieces?

    - **Challenges**: What do you anticipate will be the hardest and most time-consuming parts?

    - **Project Timeline**: What parts of the project do you anticipate you will complete in each of the next 5 weeks?

    Your proposal should be thoughtful, complete, and should take into consideration the feedback you received from me in response to your thoughts last week. You can always modify what you're doing later on, but your proposal should describe a complete project.

    The final project is your opportunity to put to work what you've learned so far in class, and to build the skills you're most interested in taking forward with you into your career. *Each assignment is in the project sequence is required, so put in the time to ensure that each is complete and well-considered!*

4.  Study for next week's in-class quiz! You may bring whatever notes you wish to the quiz, including the practice quiz. However, you may not use a computer!

    - [Email me](mailto:jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu) or [Leah](mailto:lmeyerholtz@cca.edu) if you're confused by anything, or arrange a meeting with a lab monitor or programming coach in the Hybrid Lab.
