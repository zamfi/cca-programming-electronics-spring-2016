### Homework 8 (due Sunday, March 20-27, 2016)

0. If you haven't completed the in-class electronics activity **Lab 1: LED Level Meter**, complete it! Upload your final code to GitHub in your `week8` repository. Also take a picture of your breadboard and upload that too. For bonus points, complete **Lab 2: Etch-a-sketch** too.

1. Final Project thoughts.

  - Your final project will take up the bulk of your classwork for the 2nd half of term. Think about what you'd like to do, and [send me](mailto:jzamfirescpereira@cca.edu) a 5-10 sentence description of what you'd like to do by **Sunday night, March 20**. The sooner you send me your thoughts, the sooner I can provide you with feedback and you can iterate. We'll probably go through a revision or two before you have a final idea to implement.

    Here are some notes:

    - Your project should have a significant programming component.
    - It should have some kind of input: maybe a sensor or two, a remote control, a touch control, a computer input -- perhaps through Processing?
    - It should have some kind of output: motors, LEDs, a Processing sketch, sound, video playback, a graph of data, etc.
    - It should have an artistic component.
    - It could have a mechanical component.

  - Examples of pretty good projects include:
    - Laser Light Dance Floor: a repurposed DDR pad that controls music playback and a laser light show.
    - Lit Planters: a set of 3D-printed plants that respond to people walking around and interacting.
    - Piano player: molded plastic fingers, connected to servo motors with strings, that pull the fingers down to play an electric keyboard. Reads the MIDI format and plays music!
    - SensorBot: a wall-detecting robot that follows the walls in a room, measuring distance and light level as it goes.
    - Wall Drawbot: a wall-mounted pen controlled by an Arduino that can draw an arbitrary drawing, perhaps from an SVG file.

  - Be creative! This is your chance to play with the concepts that excite you the most.

  - **As I mentioned above, we will likely go through a bit of a back-and-forth to refine your project idea -- the sooner you send it to me the more time you'll have to work on it!**

2. Print out and complete the [practice quiz](img/practice-quiz.pdf). Give yourself 2 hours, don't use your computer, and use whatever notes you plan to bring to the midterm on April 4.
   
   For the last problem, draw wires showing where you would the components' legs to the breadboard.
   
   Scan (or photograph with your cell phone) your completed practice quiz and email it to me at [jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu](mailto:jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu) (**don't put this in github**) by **Sunday night, 11:59pm on March 27**.
   
2. Learn about motors and answer the following questions. Upload your answers to the `README.md` file in your `week8` github repository by **Sunday, March 27**.
   
   1. What is the role of the permanent magnet in a motor?
   2. What is the role of the brushes in a DC motor?
   3. Imagine you have a robot and want that robot to scan the room for obstacles to decide how to move around. You have a [proximity sensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximity_sensor) that measures distance. What type of motor might you use to rotate the proximity sensor to scan the room -- a DC motor, a stepper motor, or a servo motor? Why?
