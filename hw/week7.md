### Homework 7 (due Sunday, March 13, 2016)

This assignment consists of an Arduino lab and a programming practice assignment, both due Sunday.

#### Arduino Lab

- **Assignment:** Complete the [Exploring Signals lab](http://workshopweekend.net/arduino/labs/exploring-signals). There are two parts; complete each part on "half" of your breadboard. The images all show a half size breadboard -- your breadboard is full size: two half size breadboards stuck together! No need to do the challenges, but you are free to if you like.
  
  You'll need extra parts for this lab: LEDs, wires, two light-dependent resistors (LDR), and two 10K resistors, all of which you can get from the Hybrid Lab. (If you can, do this assignment at the Hybrid Lab!)
  
  **Upload your final code to [a GitHub repository called `week7`] and email a link to [jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu](mailto:jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu). Bring your breadboard with your completed project to Wednesday's class.**


#### Programming Practice

- Let a thousand colors bloom!
  
  Modify the [thousand-bouncing-circles code](thousands.pde) we wrote in class to make each circle its own color. You may need to add a new variable to the `Ball` class.
  
  **Bonus points**: modify the display() function to draw something other than a circle: a flower, perhaps?
