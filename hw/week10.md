### Homework 10 (due Saturday, April 9, 11pm)

This homework assignment is two project project-related assignments.

#### Project Homework

1. Start your final project's **debug log**.
  
   I'd like you to keep a **debug log** for your final project. We introduced this log earlier in the semester, but to review:
   
   Every time you run in to unexpected behavior in your project (a bug, a component that works differently than you thought, or something else), make an entry in your log. Describe the following:
  
   1. In a sentence, explain the behavior you expected.
   2. In a sentence, explain the observed behavior.
   3. Formulate a hypothesis about what might be causing the mismatch: what part of your code or what part of your circuit is behaving in a way you don't expect?
   4. Test your hypothesis: what action can you take you determine if your hypothesis is true?
   5. What is the result of your test?
   6. Repeat steps iii-v above until you resolve your "bug".
   
   This is a serious bit of work, but it will help you develop very critical skills in debugging; if there is only one valuable thing you take from this class, it will be this ability. Don't skimp on it!

   **The debug log is especially useful now, as you experiment with the pieces that will eventually make up your final project.**

   **Create a `debug-log.md` file in your final project repository, and keep your notes in there. [Send me a link to your file](mailto:jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu) (it should have a record of what you've done so far!) by Saturday night, 11pm**.

2. Draft a "Bill of Materials" for your project: this is a list of the components you'll need to build your project. Each entry in the list should include a description, and a "source": where you'll get the part -- a link if you plan to buy it, or "Hybrid Lab" if the lab has one you plan to use, but please confirm in the lab that the part is available! 

   **Create a `bill-of-materials.md` file in your final project repository. [Send me a link](mailto:jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu) by Saturday night, 11pm**.

3. **Bring all the parts on your Bill of Materials with you to class this week!** (In addition to your laptop, Arduino, etc.)
